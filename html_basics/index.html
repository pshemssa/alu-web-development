        <p>I got my first html experience from my secondary classes but it was tough and the codes were still complicated as it was my first time to learn about them.</p>
        <p>Now that I'm pursuing higher web development knowledge, some other codes and additions are being added to what i knew but all the additions to my skills and knowledge are to build and make a better me for reaching my goal and mission at large. </p>
        <p>It's been quite easy and till now I'm intending to get better knoweledge</p>
        <p>I intend to become a well trained future web developer.</p>
